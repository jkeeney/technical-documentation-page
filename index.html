                <p>Coffee plants thrive in specific climatic conditions, often referred to as the "coffee belt." This region lies between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, and Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The key factors for ideal coffee growing conditions include: </p>
                <code>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Altitude: Coffee plants flourish at higher altitudes, typically between 2,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. The cooler temperatures at these elevations slow the maturation of the coffee cherries, allowing the beans to develop more complex flavors.</li>
                        <li>Climate: Consistent rainfall, mild temperatures (60-70Â°F), and well-defined wet and dry seasons are essential for healthy coffee plants. Excessive heat or cold can stress the plants and affect bean quality.</li>
                        <li>Soil: Rich, well-drained soils with good organic content provide the necessary nutrients for coffee plants. Volcanic soils are particularly favorable due to their mineral richness.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>There are two primary species of coffee plants cultivated for commercial production: </p>
                <code>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arabica (Coffea arabica): Known for its smooth, complex flavors and lower caffeine content, Arabica is the most popular coffee species. It is typically grown at higher altitudes and requires more care due to its susceptibility to pests and diseases.</li>
                        <li>Robusta (Coffea canephora): Robusta beans are known for their strong, bold flavors and higher caffeine content. These plants are hardier and can thrive at lower altitudes, making them easier to cultivate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </code>

                <header>Planting and Care</header>
                <p>The cultivation process begins with planting coffee seedlings in nurseries. Once they are strong enough, they are transplanted to coffee farms, where they are spaced to allow for adequate sunlight and airflow.</p>
                <p>Key aspects of coffee plant care include:</p>
                <code>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pruning: Regular pruning helps maintain plant health and productivity by removing dead or diseased branches and encouraging new growth.</li>
                        <li>Shade Management: Providing shade can protect coffee plants from excessive sunlight and temperature variations. Shade trees also contribute to biodiversity and soil health.</li>
                        <li>Fertilization: Organic or inorganic fertilizers supply essential nutrients to the plants, promoting healthy growth and bean development.</li>
                        <li>Pest and Disease Control: Integrated pest management techniques help control pests and diseases without relying heavily on chemical pesticides, preserving the environment and coffee quality.</li>
                    </ul>

                <header>Flowering and Cherry Development</header>
                <p>Coffee plants typically flower once or twice a year, depending on the region. The flowers are white and fragrant, attracting pollinators. After pollination, the flowers give way to green coffee cherries, which gradually ripen over several months.</p>
                <p>The ripening process varies, with cherries often turning red or yellow when ready for harvest. The time from flowering to harvest can range from six to nine months, influenced by factors like altitude and climate.</p>

                <header>Harvesting Techniques</header>
                <p>Harvesting is a labor-intensive process, crucial for ensuring high-quality coffee beans.</p>
                <p>There are two primary harvesting methods:</p>
                <code>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Selective Picking: Skilled workers hand-pick only the ripe cherries, leaving unripe ones to mature. This method ensures the highest quality beans but is time-consuming and labor-intensive.</li>
                        <li>Strip Picking: All cherries on a branch are harvested simultaneously, regardless of ripeness. This method is faster and less costly but can result in lower quality due to the inclusion of unripe or overripe cherries.</li>
                    </ul>
                </code>
                <p>In some regions, mechanical harvesters are used, especially on flat terrain. However, hand-picking remains the preferred method for specialty coffee producers due to its precision.</p>

                <header>Post-Harvest Processing</header>
                <p>Once harvested, the cherries must be processed quickly to prevent spoilage. This step involves removing the pulp and other layers to reveal the coffee beans.</p>
                <p>There are two main processing methods:</p>
                <code>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dry (Natural) Processing: Cherries are spread out in the sun to dry. This method imparts fruity and complex flavors to the beans.</li>
                        <li>Wet (Washed) Processing: Cherries are pulped to remove the outer skin, then fermented to remove the mucilage. The beans are washed and dried, producing cleaner, brighter flavors.</li>
                    </ul>
